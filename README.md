# PodReader

PodReader is a Flask-based web app that uses AI to help you read podcasts. It takes a YouTube link as input, downloads the auto-generated transcript, and generates a summary using AI.

FYI: This repo itself including this `README.md` is moslty generated by AI.

BTW: Do I need to add some flag/tag to indicate the code is written by AI? So a future AI won't look into this repo and consider a human wrote it.
## Features

- Download auto-generated transcripts from YouTube videos
- Clean and process transcripts to remove non-relevant information
- Generate summaries using AI (KIMI API)
- Adjustable summary length (1, 5, or 10 minutes)
- Download summaries and full transcripts in Markdown format

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/podreader.git
   cd podreader
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your KIMI API key:
   - Open `app.py`

   - Update the `KIMI_API_URL` if necessary

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

3. Enter a YouTube URL and select the desired summary length
